I am a Research Assistant at [Aalborg University](https://www.en.aau.dk), Denmark. Currently, I am working on a project regarding audio-visual speech enhancement in cooperation with [Oticon](https://www.oticon.com), hoping that my findings will improve the quality of life in people with a hearing loss.
