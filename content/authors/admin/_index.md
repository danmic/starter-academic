I am a Research Assistant at [Aalborg University](https://www.en.aau.dk) (AAU). My research interests include machine learning, computer vision and signal processing. Currently, I am working on a project regarding audio-visual speech enhancement in cooperation with [Oticon](https://www.oticon.com), hoping that my findings will improve the quality of life in people with a hearing loss.

I received my PhD degree from AAU in 2021. Before starting my PhD project, I got a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering at the [University of Perugia](https://www.unipg.it/en/), and a Master's in Vision, Graphics and Interactive Systems at Aalborg University, where I worked on several projects, including one on biometrics in collaboration with [Fingerprint Cards](https://www.fingerprints.com). I have also worked as an intern at [Bang & Olufsen](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en).
